"""The one place this system talks to OpenAI.

Ported near-verbatim from payoptimize, where the send-time assert below was
written and tested. Rewriting a verified privacy boundary is how it quietly
stops being verified.

A synchronous module with an injectable httpx client, so every test drives it
with a MockTransport and any async caller wraps it in a threadpool. No SDK —
the API is one POST, and a dependency would only put distance between us and
the request body we are contractually obliged to inspect.

That inspection is the point of this file: `complete` asserts the redaction
denylist against the serialized body *at the send*, after every layer above has
had its say. A redaction bug upstream becomes a loud AgentError here, not a
person's inbox in a third party's logs.

The payload is deliberately minimal — model, messages, tools. No temperature:
gpt-5 rejects non-default values, and defaults are what we want anyway.
